<P><strong>Water Quality</strong><br>
Water quality is typically categorized into physical, chemical, microbiological, and radiological parameters. As the water comes into contact with various substances in different phases of the hydraulic cycle, such as rainfall, runoff, infiltration, impoundment, use, and evaporation, many minerals get dissolved and suspended. Drinking water quality is influenced by the source water quality, the efficacy of water treatment plants, the integrity of the water distribution system, and, more importantly, the service line to households. The water quality is very critical in all design aspects of various components of the water supply system. The input quality decides the detailed engineering design of the components e.g., intake arrangements, Treatment process, boosting/ correcting measures needed in the transmission as well as the long distribution system to deliver assured water quality to all the beneficiaries. The design should also take into consideration the parameter in raw water, which are at present within the permissible limits, but have increasing trend and might change during the course of design period and make the water unfit for drinking and specific treatment is required for its removal before it can be delivered to the consumers.

The primary purpose of water quality monitoring in the water supply system is to ensure compliance with water quality criteria and standards stipulated by the concerned agencies, assess the state of water, and determine trends. Strategies need to be developed for undertaking monitoring and surveillance, collecting and analyzing data, and delineating preventive and remedial actions for the provision of safe water

<strong><i>*Here are some important things that to be checked in household water*</i></strong>

<h2>1. pH Value</h2>
<p>Healthy drinking water should have a pH between <b>6.5 and 8.5</b>.</p>

<h2>2. TDS (Total Dissolved Solids)</h2>
<p>Safe water must have TDS levels <b>below 500 mg/L</b>.</p>

<h2>3. Turbidity</h2>
<p>Clear water has turbidity below 1 NTU.</p>

<h2>4. Water Quality Index (WQI)</h2>
<p>
WQI helps understand the overall safety of water:
<br><br>
• 0–25: Excellent  
<br>
• 26–50: Good  
<br>
• 51–75: Poor  
<br>
• 76–100: Very Poor
