<img src="s1 (1).jpg"width="400px"height="500px">

<strong><b>Precautions:</b></strong>
<ul>
    <li>Use water purification systems</li>
    <li>Avoid open defecation</li>
    <li>Ensure proper sewage and drainage systems</li>
    <li>Practice handwashing with clean water</li>
    <li>Promote rainwater harvesting</li>
    <li>Use eco-friendly sanitation methods</li>
</ul>
<P><strong><I>1.Causes of the Crisis</I></strong> 
The crisis stems from a combination of environmental, infrastructural, and social factors
Outreach International<BR>
 
<B>*Climate change:</B> Altered rainfall patterns, glacial melt, and intensified droughts reduce available freshwater <BR>


<B>*Population growth and urbanization:</B> Rising demand outpaces infrastructure, particularly in developing regions <BR>


<B>*Pollution:</B> Industrial waste, untreated sewage, and agricultural runoff contaminate rivers, lakes, and groundwater <BR>


<B>*Over-extraction of groundwater:</B> Unsustainable agricultural and industrial use leads to declining water tables, affecting millions daily <BR>


<B>*Inadequate infrastructure and governance:</B> Many water systems fail due to lack of skilled professionals or sustainable management, leaving communities with unreliable water access <BR>
</P>
<p><strong>2.Impacts on Society and Economy</strong> 
Health: Unsafe water and sanitation contribute to waterborne diseases like cholera, typhoid, and dysentery, disproportionately affecting children under five 

 Lack of WASH (water, sanitation, hygiene) services contributes to nearly 10% of global disease burden in low-resource zones

 
Social inequality: Women and girls are often responsible for water collection, spending 200–250 million hours daily, which limits education and economic opportunities 


Economic costs: Globally, inadequate water and sanitation cost an estimated $260 billion annually, lowering productivity and GDP, particularly in agriculture-dependent economies 


Environmental effects: Affected ecosystems include drying rivers, wetlands, and declining biodiversity, further threatening food and water security
