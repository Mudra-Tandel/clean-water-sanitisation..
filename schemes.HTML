<h2>1. Jal Jeevan Mission</h2>
<p>A government initiative to provide safe and adequate drinking water to all rural households in India through functional tap connections by 2024. The mission focuses on creating infrastructure, empowering communities to manage their water systems, and incorporating source sustainability measures like rainwater harvesting and greywater reuse. It has made significant progress, with over 15.44 crore rural households provided with tap water connections, which has helped alleviate the burden of water collection for women and improved public health outcomes. </p>

<h2>2. Swachh Bharat Mission</h2>
<p>The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is a nationwide cleanliness campaign launched by the Indian government on October 2, 2014, to honor Mahatma Gandhi's vision of a clean India. The mission aims to improve sanitation, eliminate open defecation, and manage solid waste by constructing toilets, improving infrastructure, and raising public awareness. It has become a mass movement involving citizens from all walks of life to make India clean and hygienic.</p>

<h2>3. Atal Bhujal Yojana</h2>
<p>The Atal Bhujal Yojana (Atal Jal) is a Central Sector Scheme launched by the Government of India to improve groundwater management in water-stressed areas of seven states: Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. It focuses on community-led, sustainable groundwater management through active community participation, behavioral change, and convergence of various government schemes. The scheme aims to strengthen institutional frameworks for participatory management and build community awareness on water conservation. </p>

<h2>4. National Rural Drinking Water Programme</h2>
<p>The National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) was the Indian government's flagship scheme to provide safe and adequate drinking water to all rural households on a sustainable basis, launched in 2009. It was replaced in August 2019 by the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), which continues the goal of providing tap water connections to every rural home. The NRDWP's original objectives included community participation, water quality monitoring, and providing sustainable water supplies.</p>
