<h1>SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation</h1>
<P>
            <strong><i></i><strong></strong>
        <P>
        <p>
            <strong><I>SDG 6:</I></strong> Aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030.
            It focuses on providing clean drinking water, improving hygiene, building safe sanitation systems,
            and reducing water pollution.
        </p>
        
           <strong><I>Importance of SDG 6:</I></strong> 
Access to clean water and sanitation is fundamental to public health, food security, and gender equality. Lack of clean water sources and sanitation facilities leads to waterborne diseases, increased child mortality, and disproportionately affects women and girls, who often bear responsibility for water collection. Efficient water management also reduces environmental degradation and supports climate resilience.
SDG 6 in India and Maharashtra Context
        </P>
        <P><strong><i>SDG 6 In India and Maharashtra Context:</i></strong>
            India has made significant efforts toward achieving SDG 6 through initiatives such as:
Swachh Bharat Mission (Clean India): Focused on ending open defecation, building toilets, and promoting hygiene.
Jal Jeevan Mission: Aims to provide safe and adequate drinking water through piped connections to every rural household by 2024, with ongoing urban extension.
Local water conservation projects: In Maharashtra, rainwater harvesting and wastewater recycling programs are being implemented, especially in urban areas like Kurla, Mumbai, to address water shortages and sanitation demands.
Challenges and Actions Needed
        </P>
        <P>
            <strong><I>Challenges and Actions Needed</I></strong>
            Despite progress, challenges remain:
Inequitable access in slums and marginalized communities
Water pollution from industrial, domestic, and agricultural sources
Over-extraction of groundwater, leading to depletion
Need for behavioral change programs to promote hygiene and proper sanitation
Actions to accelerate progress include investing in water infrastructure, promoting wastewater treatment, encouraging water conservation, supporting community-led sanitation projects, and enhancing monitoring and governance mechanisms. 
        </P>
        <P><strong><I>Conclusion::</I></strong>
        As the global population grows, so do the demands for water—for drinking, sanitation, farming and energy production, among many other uses. At the same time, human activity and the climate crisis are disrupting natural water cycles, while pollution is putting freshwater ecosystems under pressure.   

UNEP helps countries protect and restore freshwater ecosystems to sustain their services for generations to come. To do this, UNEP collects data and reports on the status of water quality and the health of freshwater ecosystems; provides training and policy advice to help countries and communities better manage their water resources, especially in the face of the climate crisis and supports innovative pilot projects, including nature-based solutions, to protect and restore freshwater sources. UNEP also brings together a wide array of partners, including Member States, to spur action on water-related issues.  </P>
